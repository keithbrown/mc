== Requirements

This section is only required if there is no preceding design note. 
If present it describes the requirements that need to be satisfied.  If there 
is an SRS, this section may refer to it.  Each requirement should be as short 
and simple as possible and must be clearly defined.

=== Item 1  
==== Example sub-item
Paragraphs can start here.

* Example List Element
  - Example Sub list item with example named document reference <<dr-2,Analyze Options for Migration>>
    + Example sub sub list item (indent and change bullet)

=== Item 2  
==== Example sub-item

* Example List Element

== Work Required

Elaborate on each point of the Work Required section of the design note and
describe how you implemented each step.  
If there is no design note, this section, breaks out the consequential work 
(as a numbered list) needed to meet the requirements specified in the 
Requirements section. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

=== Item 1  
==== Example sub-item

== Implementation Comments

If the design cannot be implemented as written or if it needs some modification,
enumerate the changes to the design in this section.  If there was no preceding
design note, then this section documents any deviations from the implementation
as presented at the pre-implementation engineering review. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

=== Item 1  
```java
    // java code example
    public void clearDatabase(IProgressMonitor pm) 
    {
        // clear the corresponding graphics-root's database
        OoaofgraphicsUtil.clearGraphicsDatabase(rootId, pm);

        Ooaofooa.getDefaultInstance().fireModelElementUnloaded(this);
    }
```
