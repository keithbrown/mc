= Document Templates

Copy a template file from here when creating a new engineering note.
There are templates here for Analysis Note, Design Note and Implementation
Note among others.

Most of these templates should not be changed here.  Simply copy the versions
from the xtuml/bridgepoint repository.  The copies here are for convenience
to those who have not forked the xtuml/bridgepoint repository.  If you note
changes you would like, raise an issue or change the version over in the other
repository.
