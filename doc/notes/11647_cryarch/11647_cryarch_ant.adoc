xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

Analysis is performed on architectural features of a model compiler to
implement various security related capabilities.

== 2 Introduction and Background

It is desirable to run private applications securely on shared compute
resources.  Some applications require resistence to tampering or reverse
engineering.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Encrypted Persistence
Persistent data (instances) shall be encrypted.

=== 3.2 Constant Cycles
It shall be possible to establish a relatively constant rate of resource usage.

== 4 Analysis

=== 4.0.1 Questions

. How are legitimate threads of control initiated?
. How are bogus threads of control initiated?
. How are legitimate and bogus ToCs distinguished?

=== 4.0.2 Glossary

[horizontal]
dispatcher::  architectural construct which queues events and dispatches state actions for one or many domains (components)
message (also public domain function)::  an invocation from outside the domain which initiates a thread of control (ToC)
prescribed energy::  duration of time and/or number of cycles to be consumed by a thread of control
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing[secret splitting]::  dividing information to increase requirements on reconstructing a secret and thus increasing confidentiality by making the task of the eavesdropper more difficult
steganography::  Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination.
thread of control (ToC)::  sequence of state action dispatches starting with an external stimulus (message or timer) and ending when the state machines quiesce (empty event queues)
thread of control identifier (ToCI)::  this gets passed to each state dispatch and propagates through events

=== 4.0.3 Musings

An identifier (ToCI) is assigned to a thread of control upon initiation of processing.
It is carried within any events generated in this thread of control.

Consider 'higher than' and 'lower than' as criteria for discriminating ToCs.

* bogus threads of control
  ** states of state machines on bogus classes
  ** operations on bogus classes
  ** extra states on legitimate classes
  ** extra operations on legitimate classes
  ** creation and deletion of bogus classes
  ** writes to attributes on bogus classes

* Bogus actions
  ** duplicates of legitimate actions working on bogus instances
  ** idempotent
    *** Define https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence[idempotence] and tie it to cryptographic obfuscation.

The dispatcher can measure time and cycles.
What if I could produce a message generator that generated both legitimate and bogus messages.
All messages return the time and cycles consumed by the thread of control.
It would dispatch bogus messages with
energy requirements.  These would precipitate threads of control through
bogus states that would quiesce after the 

Domains need to be constant time and cycles.
A cryptographic dispatcher is at the center of each domain.

The passed energy requirements needs to be encrypted.  ??

=== 4.1 Data Encryption

* All stored instance data is encrypted.

=== 4.2 Constant Cycles

* The time usage of each dispatch is measured.

=== 4.3 Constant Energy

== 5 Work Required

== 6 Acceptance Test

Nice! Question: imagine you go to handle your tqueue and there are 2 popped timers in them. Do you dispatch the first event, then drain the event queues or do you go ahead and dispatch both events before going back to the event queues
The question is even more tricky than that.
What if you have 3 timers that are ready, and the first two have exactly the same expiration time.
?
I think the answer is to dispatch the 2 together and then return to the dispatcher to deal with self events and instance events before dispatching the 3rd (already expired) timer.
Our concept of 'simulated time' helps me think this way.

 select any e from instances of aevent;
 while ( not_empty e )

  // Fully service self queue before instance queue.
  e = selfq.dequeue();
  if ( empty e )
    e = iq.dequeue();
  end if;
  if ( not_empty e )
    // Impinge event against the target state machine.
    e.deliver();
  else
    // timers
    // messages
  end if;

 end while;

Concept of simulated time.  (discrete event simulation)
