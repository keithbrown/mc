xtUML Project Analysis Note

== Abstract

A Shlaer-Mellor standard software runtime is described with enhancements
to suppress leakage of runtime profiles through time and energy usage.

== Introduction and Background

It is desirable to run private applications securely on shared compute
resources.  Some applications require resistence to tampering or reverse
engineering.

== Outline

. aims of this presentation
  .. elucidating fundamentals of Shlaer-Mellor runtime
  .. introducing security extensions to the core of the runtime model
     ... obscuring state sequencing
     ... obscuring message sequencing
     ... obscuring resource (energy) utilization
     ... leveling of resource utilization
     ... not speaking to existing code body obfuscation techniques

. fundamental elements of a Shlaer-Mellor software architecture
  .. direct translation of model elements
     ... classes, state machines, action language
         .... class - class, struct, table
         .... state machine - nested switch/case statement, 2 dimensional lookup table
         .... action language - each statement maps to lower level construct
              ..... relationship creation, deletion and navigation
  .. collections
     ... instances, relationship extents, transient sets
         .... instances
         .... relationship lists
         .... transient sets
  .. runtime core
     ... event, timer and message dispatching
         .... event queueing (self and instance)
         .... timer management
         .... message passing
     ... This is the focus of this presentation.
     ... security extensions to be made to the runtime core

. simulation
  .. models themselves
  .. rules
  .. runtime

. simulation:  executing the models
  .. Verifier
  .. iUML executor
  .. Inspector
  .. penny simulation
     ... Do it with Pub or MicrowaveOven model (on printouts, screen and flip chart).
  .. GPSW "pulse" in simulation (video clips from Verifier, MC-3020, strung together)

. (meta) model levels
  .. application model
  .. meta model
  .. model compiler model

. deeper into the S-M runtime
  .. how it works
     ... classes and instances, state models and state machines (course slides:  Microwave Oven 189-194)
     ... queue:  event queue (head, tail, next, instance, event number)
     ... strength of the S-M event dispatcher WRT behavior sequencing
       .... example of instrumentation for tracing (video of Verifier and MC-3020 MWO)
         ..... IBM fiber channel control unit
         ..... BAS "can't happen" war story
     ... exposure of the S-M event dispatcher WRT side channel cryptanalysis
     ... growth of shared resource (cloud) computing
       .... Amazon AWS in particular
  .. operating model of S-M runtime
     ... distinctives of a "model-based model compiler" (aka "What I mean by this term.")
         .... MM instance loading
         .... thus OOA of OOA is key subsystem
         .... templated serialization of text ('model2text')
         .... otherwise model compiler is a normal S-M model
     ... class diagram (Navigate in BP perfectly, zooming and taking screen shots.)
     ... dispatcher state model
     ... time rules
     ... event rules
     ... actually 4 queues:  self events, instance events, timers, messages
  .. cryptographically extended model of S-M runtime (again)
     ... Thread of Control
     ... energy quantum
     ... PID

. S-M resource usage analyzed
  .. energy measurement
  .. square wave time usage (GPSW figure)
  .. square wave energy usage (GPSW figure)
    ... correlated with state behavior
  .. object/state output represented as letters/numbers (GPSW figure)
  .. simplistic steganographic translation of multiple models together into
     the same build
  .. more purposeful steganographic translation of the same model with variation
     of the states and activities

. demo
  .. GPSW unobscured
    ... time profile
    ... energy profile
    ... state, message and energy patterns
  .. GPSW obscured
    ... time profile
    ... energy profile
    ... state, message and energy patterns

. review
  .. elucidating the fundamentals of Shlaer-Mellor runtime
  .. introducing security extensions to the core of the runtime model
     ... obscuring state sequencing
     ... obscuring message sequencing
     ... obscuring resource (energy) utilization
     ... leveling of resource utilization

== Key Points

* S-M time and event rules make tracing behavior really easy.
* Thus, S-M time and event rules make eavesdropping and behavior deduction easier.
* Thread of Control is a key element, and modeling it gives us access.
* How do we leverage the Tread of Control?

== Figures

* square wave representation of GPSWrunning
* object/state output represented as letters/numbers.
* compressibility of this output
