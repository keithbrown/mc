= OOA of MASL:  Parse and Load MASL Activity

xtUML Project Design Note

== 1 Abstract

MASL action language shall be parsed and loaded into an xtUML model of
MASL activity.  This note documents design steps to achieve this parsing.

== 2 Introduction and Background

See <<dr-3>> and <<dr-4>>.

== 3 Requirements

See <<dr-3>> and <<dr-4>>.

== 4 Analysis

== 5 Design

=== 5.1 Parser

The primary MASL parser is built into the MASL model compiler.  It exists
at <<dr-5, MASL parser>>.  A derivative of this parser was crafted for the
MASL-to-xtUML and xtUML-to-MASL tooling.  It is found <<dr-6,here>>.

For this work, an approach similar to the m2x and x2m tooling is taken.
This will leverage the work of resecting the parser from the larger model
compiler.  The key file is `Walker.g`.

== 6 Design Comments

* We need to be able to select by name.  For example, in an
  AttributeDeclaration, selecting a TypeDeclaration based on the type
  reference text.
* We also need to navigate sub/super.  For example, a TypeDeclaration has
  a name, but I need the instance of the BasicType subtype to link to an
  AttributeDeclation.
* I think there needs to be a description field on several elements.  Maybe
  everything that has a name should also have a description.  Maybe a
  supertype element should have the description field.  Skipping it for now.
* What should we do with domain references to domains not loaded?  This
  can occur with ExceptionReference (and maybe types).
* So far, there is still no type reference class in the model.
  (hmmm, maybe UserDefinedType, but I do not think so)
* I created ReferentialAttribute and linked it on both ends to the source
  attribute.  I plan to select them later and link the referring end.
  Not sure the best way to go about this.  Considering adding a function
  to the model.
* Consideration of RelationshipSpecification (not really a first class
  meta-model element).
* namedTypeRef is UDT somehow...
* I need to understand how to recurse the expression hierarchy.
* There are several places where I will need to do a symbol look-up.
  ** identifier within expression
  ** ServiceInvocation - This is where ServiceOverload is used when
     resolving the name thus resolving the subtype.
  ** exceptionReference
  ** optionalDomainReference
  ** optionalObjectReference
* I should factor ServiceInvocation out of statement and into invocation.
